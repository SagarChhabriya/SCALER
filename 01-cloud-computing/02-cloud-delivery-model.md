# Cloud Delivery Model


## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

### **Overview**

* Introduces IaaS, along with PaaS and SaaS.
* Explains IaaS architecture and its pros/cons.



### **What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

* Cloud service offering computing, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis.
* Users manage software components; provider manages underlying infrastructure.
* Example: Azure Virtual Machines.



### **IaaS Architecture**

* Cloud provider hosts servers, storage, networking, and virtualization layers.
* Includes services like monitoring, billing, security, load balancing, backups, and recovery.



### **Major IaaS Vendors and Products**

* Popular vendors: Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Azure VMs, MicroHost Cloud, Linode, Google Compute Engine.



### **Things to Consider While Choosing an IaaS Provider**

* **Security:** Check provider’s track record and disaster recovery systems.
* **Flexibility:** Ability to scale resources as needed.
* **Reliability:** Performance and runtime depend on provider’s hardware/software.



### **Service Level Agreements (SLA)**

* Defines expected service performance and penalties for non-compliance.
* Essential in contracts with IT vendors.
* Standard SLAs exist but should be reviewed by clients for fairness.



### **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

* Private cloud environment within a public cloud.
* Offers higher security and logical separation.
* Allows running code, storing data, hosting websites with private-cloud isolation and public-cloud scalability.



### **Advantages of IaaS**

* Reduces need for on-premises infrastructure and hardware costs.
* Scalable resources and faster provisioning.
* Pay-as-you-use model avoids unnecessary expenses.
* Removes burden of managing physical servers and data centers.



### **Disadvantages of IaaS**

* Businesses still manage security for their hosted content.
* Integration with existing systems can be complex.
* Costs may increase due to usage spikes.



### **IaaS vs. SaaS vs. PaaS**

* **IaaS:** Provides raw computing resources; users manage platforms and applications.
* **PaaS:** Provides environment and tools for developing and deploying applications.
* **SaaS:** Cloud-hosted applications accessible via web/API; no local installation required.



### **IaaS vs. Containers vs. Serverless**

* **Containers:** Package app code and dependencies; smaller and faster than VMs.
* **Kubernetes:** Manages large-scale containerized applications; often provided by IaaS vendors.
* **Serverless:** Abstracts servers completely; cloud provider handles scaling and infrastructure.
* IaaS requires users to manage capacity changes manually.



### **Conclusion**

* Summarizes IaaS, related cloud models (PaaS, SaaS), and IaaS architecture.
* Recaps advantages, disadvantages, SLAs, and VPC concepts.
