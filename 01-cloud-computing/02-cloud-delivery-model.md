# Cloud Delivery Model


## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Here is the rewritten **short bullet-point version with an example added under each heading**:



### **Overview**

* Introduces IaaS along with PaaS and SaaS; covers architecture, pros/cons, SLA, and VPC.
  **Example:** A company shifting from physical servers to cloud infrastructure to reduce maintenance.



### **What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

* Provides on-demand computing, storage, and networking; users manage software, provider manages hardware.
* Pay-as-you-go model.
  **Example:** Using Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines to host enterprise applications without buying servers.



### **IaaS Architecture**

* Provider manages servers, storage, networking, virtualization, and additional services like monitoring, security, and backups.
  **Example:** AWS offering EC2 instances with CloudWatch monitoring and automated backups.



### **Major IaaS Vendors and Products**

* Popular vendors: Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Azure VMs, MicroHost Cloud, Linode, Google Compute Engine.
  **Example:** A startup hosting its web app on DigitalOcean droplets for quick deployment.



### **Things to Consider While Choosing an IaaS Provider**

* **Security:** Strong security and disaster recovery.
* **Flexibility:** Easy scaling of resources.
* **Reliability:** Performance and low downtime.
  **Example:** A business choosing AWS for its proven uptime and global availability zones.



### **Service Level Agreements (SLA)**

* Defines expected performance, availability, and penalties.
* Essential for clarity and accountability between vendor and client.
  **Example:** An SLA guaranteeing 99.9% uptime for Azure Virtual Machines.



### **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**

* Private, isolated section of a public cloud with enhanced security.
* Supports storing data, running apps, hosting sites securely.
  **Example:** A bank using a VPC on Google Cloud to securely store financial transaction data.



### **Advantages of IaaS**

* Reduces physical infrastructure costs.
* Scalable and fast provisioning.
* Pay only for usage.
  **Example:** An e-commerce site scaling server capacity during festive sales and reducing it afterward.



### **Disadvantages of IaaS**

* Users must secure apps and data.
* May require complex integration.
* Costs can spike unexpectedly.
  **Example:** A company facing higher bills during unexpected traffic surges.



### **IaaS vs. SaaS vs. PaaS**

* **IaaS:** Raw computing resources.
* **PaaS:** Application development environment.
* **SaaS:** Ready-to-use cloud apps.
  **Example:**

  * IaaS → AWS EC2
  * PaaS → Google App Engine
  * SaaS → Salesforce



### **IaaS vs. Containers vs. Serverless**

* **Containers:** Lightweight, package app + dependencies.
* **Kubernetes:** Manages containerized workloads.
* **Serverless:** Provider handles scaling; no server management.
  **Example:** Deploying microservices using Docker containers and managing them with Kubernetes on GCP.



### **Conclusion**

* Recaps IaaS, related models, architecture, benefits, challenges, SLAs, and VPCs.
  **Example:** Organizations adopting IaaS to modernize their IT infrastructure while minimizing hardware overhead.
