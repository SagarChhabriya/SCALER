# Module 1: Fundamentals of Cloud Computing

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
  - distribution of computing resources as a service
  - cloud providers like GCP, AWS, Azure, and so on

### History

  - Client-Server: one of the initial models: the server-side houses all of the client's data and control. If a single user wants to access some data, they must first connect to the server before being granted access.
  - Distributed computing model: multiple computers were connected with the help of networking, making it possible for the users to share resources as needed.
	
But both these models had one or the other disadvantage associated with them. All these factors gave rise to what we know as the cloud computing model, which covers a lot of constraints that were present in the previous models. Below are the names of some cloud providers:

  - AWS: 2002, launched EC2 in 2006
  - GCP: 2009, 
  - Azure: 2009
  - Others: Alibaba, IBM, Oracle, and HP

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

  - Acquiring resources as you go
  - High scalability
  - Statistics Generation
  - Resource Pooling


### Types of Cloud Computing

  - Public Cloud
  - Private Cloud
  - Hybrid Cloud
  - Community Cloud


#### Public Cloud

  - Less expensive compared to private and hybrid.
  - No worries about maintenance 
  - Integration is Simple
  - no cap on the number of users because it is open to everyone
  - Due to the internet-based nature of public cloud services, they are location agnostic.
  - security might be a concern since resources are shared publicly on public clouds, making them less secure.
  - The performance also depends on factors like the speed of the internet connection.
  - Ex: Google App Engine, AWS EC2, etc

#### Private Cloud

  - also known as internal or corporate clouds
  - Organizations use private clouds to operate their own data centers, either internally or through a third party.	
  - The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) divides private clouds into the following categories based on location and management: On-premise private cloud and Outsourced private cloud.
  - The users benefit from a high level of security and privacy thanks to private clouds.
	

#### Community Cloud

  - To share information between an organization and a particular community
  - the community cloud is economical
  - It is more secure than a public cloud.
  - Community clouds are not an appropriate choice if there is no teamwork involved.
  - In terms of data storage and bandwidth, there always exists an upper cap as all community members share a set of resources.

#### Hybrid Cloud

  - Hybrid clouds are a combination of public and private clouds.
  - only users within the business can access services running on a private cloud, while anyone can access those running on a public cloud.
  - Ex: Office 365, Google Application Suite, Amazon Web Services
  - Hybrid clouds are beneficial for organizations that need more security than public clouds. 

#### Multi Cloud
Multi-cloud is a cloud computing paradigm where an organization uses a combination of clouds to distribute applications and services. These clouds can be two or more public clouds, two or more private clouds, or a combination of public, private, and edge clouds.


### Types of Cloud Services

  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
  - SaaS (Software as a Service)
  - Serverless
  - XaaS (Anything as a Service): refers to a broad class of cloud computing and remote access services
  

### Pros and Cons of Cloud Computing

  - fast and easier to retrieve saved information from anywhere at any time.
  - It is easier to obtain a backup when using cloud computing.
  - good internet connection and dominance of the cloud operator

### Risks Costs and Ethics in Cloud Computing

  - Security
  - Costs
  - Data Persistence
