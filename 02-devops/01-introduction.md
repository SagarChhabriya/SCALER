### **What is DevOps?**

* **Definition:** A set of practices and cultural philosophies combining **development and operations** for faster, reliable software delivery.
* **Core Principles:**

  1. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Regularly merge code into a central repository with automated testing.
  2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Keep software in a deployable state at all times.
  3. **Continuous Deployment:** Automatically deploy software to production once it passes tests.


### **How DevOps Works**

* Breaks down **silos** between development and operations teams.
* Promotes **shared responsibility** for software quality, deployment, and monitoring.
* Emphasizes **automation**, **feedback loops**, and iterative improvements for software.


### **DevOps Lifecycle**

Seven key phases:

1. **Continuous Development:** Initiate projects, define vision, manage code with version control.
2. **Continuous Integration:** Regular code integration, automated builds, and testing.
3. **Continuous Testing:** Use automated testing tools (Selenium, JUnit) to catch bugs early.
4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Track performance and detect issues in real time.
5. **Continuous Feedback:** Incorporate user and operational feedback into development cycles.
